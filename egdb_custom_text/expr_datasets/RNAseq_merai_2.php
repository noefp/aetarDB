  RNA-seq of <i>Aethionema arabicum</i> CYP seeds exposed to different light conditions.
</p>
<h4>Experimental Conditions (3 replicates):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1d_WT: 1 day light exposure of seeds (non-dormant)</li>
    <li>7d_WT: 7 days light exposure of seeds (dormant)</li>
    <li>1d_rgl2: rgl2 mutant 1 day light exposure of seeds (non-dormant)</li>
    <li>7d_rgl2: rgl2 mutant 7 days light exposure (non-dormant)</li>
  </ul>

   Experiments were conducted with <i>Aethionema arabicum</i> accessions CYP (obtained from Eric Schranz, Wageningen), Iran8456-1, Iran8456-2, and Iran8458 (obtained from Setareh Mohammadin, Wageningen), Aethionema carneum (Banks & Sol.) B.Fedtsch. accession KM2496, and Aethionema heterocarpum Trev. accessions KM2491 and KM2614 (obtained from Klaus Mummenhoff, Osnabrück). All seed material was produced by plants grown under 16 h light/19 °C and 8 h dark/16 °C diurnal cycles, under ~50 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity. Indehiscent and dehiscent fruits encompassing non-mucilaginous and mucilaginous seeds, respectively, were manually separated and sieved. After seed harvesting, seed stocks were kept dry at 24 °C for a minimum of 2 months. RNA libraries were sequenced in 50 bp single-end mode on Illumina HiSeq 2000 Analyzers, which were processed, analyzed and normalized to RPKM.
