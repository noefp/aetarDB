  The seeds of one <i>Ae. arabicum</i> accession from Cyprus (CYP) germinates only in the dark, while light inhibits the germination. This phenotype if also called photoinhibition, or negative photoblasty.  Extended light illumination also induces secondary seed dormancy, when the seeds are not germinating even when they are transferred back to the optimal dark condition. A mutant seed collection in the CYP accession of Ae. arabicum was explored to identify mutants in which the photoinhibition and the secondary dormancy is decoupled. The seeds of <i>rgl2</i> mutant do not germinate under light as the photoinhibition is operating but the seeds fail to enter the secondary dormancy. Seeds of WT and <i>rgl2</i> genotype were compared after 1 day light treatment when the photoinhibition occurs but the seeds not yet dormant; and after 7 days light, when the WT seeds established secondary dormancy but the <i>rgl2</i> seeds not.
