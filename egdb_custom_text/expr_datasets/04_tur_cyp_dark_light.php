   The seed germination in response to light shows natural variation in two accessions of Aethionema arabicum (Brassicaceae). One accession from Turkey (TUR) germinates well in darkness and light, while another closely related accession from Cyprus (CYP) germinates only in the dark. To understand the transcriptional differences between the two accession, we performed RNA-seq analysis from imbibed seeds, which were kept either in darkness or under light for 23 hours. 
   Experiments were conducted with <i>Aethionema arabicum</i> accessions CYP (obtained from Eric Schranz, Wageningen), Iran8456-1, Iran8456-2, and Iran8458 (obtained from Setareh Mohammadin, Wageningen), Aethionema carneum (Banks & Sol.) B.Fedtsch. accession KM2496, and Aethionema heterocarpum Trev. accessions KM2491 and KM2614 (obtained from Klaus Mummenhoff, Osnabrück). All seed material was produced by plants grown under 16 h light/19 °C and 8 h dark/16 °C diurnal cycles, under ~50 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity. Indehiscent and dehiscent fruits encompassing non-mucilaginous and mucilaginous seeds, respectively, were manually separated and sieved. After seed harvesting, seed stocks were kept dry at 24 °C for a minimum of 2 months. RNA libraries were sequenced in 50 bp single-end mode on Illumina HiSeq 2000 Analyzers, which were processed, analyzed and normalized to RPKM.
