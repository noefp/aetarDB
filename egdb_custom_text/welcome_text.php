        Aethionema arabicum is a plant with diaspore heteromorphism, a case observed in few plant species.
        It produces two types of fruits, one bigger and dehiscent that produces 2 to 6 mucilagenous seeds (M+)
        and another one indehiscent, which only contains one non-mucilagenous seed (M-).
        This provides the plant alternative strategies of dispersion of the seeds and germination times depending
        on the environmental conditions.
        M+ seeds would stick to the substrate and would remain close to the mother plant, while the M- seeds,
        inside an indehiscent fruit with wings would be dispersed longer distances by wind or water currents.
        Moreover, it has been observed <i>Ae. arabicum</i> shows plasticity to change the proportion of the two types of
        fruits depending on environmental responses such as temperature or branch cutting.
        Because of all these features, <i>Ae. arabicum</i> is an excellent model to study seed development, regulation,
        germination, dormancy and fruit dehiscence mechanisms.

        <i>Ae. arabicum</i> is part of the Brassicaceae family and it is the sister group to the rest of the Brassicaceae (core-group).
        This group includes plants of interest such as cabbage, rapeseed, mustard and the model plant <i>A. thaliana</i>.
        The position of <i>Ae. arabicum</i> in the Brassicaceae family facilitates comparative genomics analyses and makes of <i>Ae. arabicum</i>
        a very interesting candidate for phylogenetic and evolutionary studies.
